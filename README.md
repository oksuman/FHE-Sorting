# sorting-fhe

Blind sorting using the CKKS scheme.

## Overview

This project implements sorting algorithms for real numbers encrypted under the CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme using the OpenFHE library. The core implementation is based on the following paper:

> [Optimized Rank Sort for Encrypted Real Numbers](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1170.pdf)

In addition, the repository includes implementations sorting methods from:

- **k-way sorting**

- **MEHP24**  
  [MEHP24] F. Mazzone, M. H. Everts, F. Hahn, and A. Peter, *Efficient Ranking, Order Statistics, and Sorting under CKKS*, to appear in USENIX Security 2025.  
  This implementation is based on their OpenFHE-based implementation: [https://github.com/FedericoMazzone/openfhe-statistics](https://github.com/FedericoMazzone/openfhe-statistics)

## Requirements

- C++ (g++ â‰¥ 9.4.0)
- CMake â‰¥ 3.5
- Git
- OpenFHE library

### Installing OpenFHE

To install the OpenFHE library, refer to:

- Source code: [https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development)  
- Documentation: [https://openfhe-development.readthedocs.io](https://openfhe-development.readthedocs.io)

> ðŸ“¦ This project includes Google Benchmark and GoogleTest as submodules.

## Installation

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/oksuman/sorting-fhe.git
cd sorting-fhe
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Running Tests

After building:

```bash
./DirectSortTest              # Run an unit test
```

## Benchmarking & Experiments

To run experimental comparisons among sorting algorithms:

```bash
cd comparison
bash run_experiments.sh
```

This script evaluates performance using internally generated arrays of distinct real numbers with uniform gaps.
